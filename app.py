"""
app.py — Main Entry Point (HARDENED)
======================================
Starts four threads:
  1. Trading engine  — generates & sends signals
  2. Chat bot        — responds to user messages
  3. Payment system  — handles payment proof & admin approval
  4. Web dashboard   — Flask server

HARDENING CHANGES:
  - Each thread wrapped in a crash-resistant safe_thread() with auto-restart
  - Thread death is detected and restarted automatically (max 10 retries)
  - Startup errors are caught gracefully per-component
  - notify_admin failure does NOT crash startup
  - KeyboardInterrupt and signal handling are robust
  - All threads are daemon threads — process exits cleanly on main thread exit
